## About the Project

Half-Life Caffeine Tracker is a single-purpose static web application that helps you visualize the degradation (half-life) of caffeine in your body over time. The app uses a scientifically-backed caffeine metabolism model to show you your current and projected caffeine levels.

### Key Features

- **Caffeine Intake Tracking**: Log your caffeine consumption with precise timestamps
- **Visualization**: See your caffeine levels on an interactive chart with projections
- **Drink Database**: Access a comprehensive database of common caffeinated beverages
- **Personalization**: Customize metabolism settings based on your biology
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data stored locally in your browser - no server tracking
